# Revamp

## Ideas

### User-facing

- Mean/Median/Stddev column per season (row)
- Add 'curated score' column? Per season, per show. Mix of mean/stddev/vote count.
- Modernize frontend -- grey background looks rough. Make nice & modern, while maintaining snappy/responsive UI.
- Episode name when hovering on episode?
- Graph (plotly) of episode ratings: one line per season, including average
- New page: viewing/comparing shows
  - Allow ranking shows by some combination of criteria e.g. # of episodes, # votes, consistency, etc
  - Graph averages for multiple shows: each point on x axis is season, each line a different show
- Highlight "good episodes" threshold. Useful for anthology episodes where you just wanna see the top ones from a given season/show.
- Light/dark theme switch.
- Add heatmap for multiple shows -- append panels.
- User shortcut for going back to search box, other controls.
- localStorage for previously searched shows, starred shows

### Backend

- README mentions data job being slow. Not a big deal, tho can identify why. 
- TypeScript/React migration?
